# `pr05` Code of Conduct

## Who We Are

The Processing Foundation is a nonprofit whose mission is to promote 
software literacy in the arts and visual literacy in the field of technology. 

Our efforts also aim to support people of all backgrounds and actively address 
systemic biases in art and tech spaces, in particular, those related to gender, 
race, class, and accessibility.

This means that we:

* Welcome contributors at any stage of their programming journey, from newcomers to professionals.
* Do not assume knowledge or imply there are things that somebody should know.
* Understand that people are the experts of their own experiences, and bring a variety of valid perspectives to the development of open source projects.
* Know that contribution is not just limited to code, and can also include working on documentation, filing issues and bug reports, and other important forms of input.
* Work to offer help and guidance when we are able to do so.

## Our Standards

All developers participating in the `pr05` program agree to abide by the following code of conduct.

### Respect other people

Treat other community members with respect and kindness. Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy toward other people, and assuming best intentions;
* Being mindful in how we approach and interact with others;
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences;
* Listening in times of conflict, and communicating as best we can while acknowledging each other's feelings;
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback;
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience;
* Making space for everyone to be heard.

### Be mindful of how you engage with others

The following behavior will not be tolerated:

* The use of sexualized or violent language or imagery;
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances of any kind;
* Offensive comments related to race, class, gender identity and expression, 
neuro-type, ability, religion and culture, age, skill level, occupation, background, or political opinion;
* Public or private harassment;
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission;
* Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

When in doubt, if it could make people uncomfortable, don't do it.

### Be open-minded

We understand that technology changes all the time, and that contributors may bring new or different views based on their own experiences. Be open-minded when engaging with other people and their ideas, and embrace the new or unfamiliar as opportunities for positive change.

### Be considerate

We focus on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the health of the overall community. Be considerate of other people, and think about how your contributions will affect the community as a whole.


## Enforcement

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing safety@processing.org. Please include your name and a description of the incident, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

Sometimes, participants violating the Code of Conduct are unaware that their behavior is harmful, and an open conversation clears things up to move forward. However, if a participant continues with the behavior, the Processing Foundation team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all community spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other members or the general public.
