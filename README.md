# pr05 = “Processing Foundation Software Development Grant”; 

The Processing Foundation Software Development Grant or `pr05` (pronounced “pros”) is a fully remote mentorship initiative by the Processing Foundation designed to support the professional growth of emerging software developers through hands-on involvement in open-source projects. 

The program will pair participants with experienced contributors who will mentor them as they work on specific projects within the Processing and p5.js ecosystems. Beyond merely supporting software projects, `pr05` offers an opportunity to develop their skills to those who have faced barriers to professional growth in tech. 

## Projects
Participants will work on self-contained projects that can be completed by one developer under mentorship. This year, we focus on supporting projects that will solidify and expand the foundations of Processing and p5.js. We have a curated list of projects——each mentored by an experienced contributor in this specific area.

See the [2024 `pr05` Project List](https://github.com/processing/pr05-grant/wiki/2024-Project-List-for-%60pr05%60-=-Processing-Foundation-Software-Development-Grant).

## Town halls
Throughout the program, monthly meetings guided by invited experts will cover critical subjects such as governance, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), UX design, accessibility, or community. These sessions are meant to expand participants' understanding of the broader context in which their technical work resides, ensuring they are well-rounded in both their coding abilities and their comprehension of the ethical and operational frameworks of the software. Town halls are hosted together with our partner program the Processing Fellowship.

## Grant
Participants will receive grants $10,000 for 200 hours of work. Full payment is contingent on complete and active participation in the program, including cohort meetings, town halls, regular meetings with mentors, and successful evaluations.
