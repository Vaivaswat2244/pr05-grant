The Processing Foundation Software Development Grant or pr05 (pronounced “pros”) is a fully remote mentorship initiative by the Processing Foundation designed to support the professional growth of emerging software developers through hands-on involvement in open-source projects. The program will pair participants with experienced contributors who will mentor them as they work on specific projects within the Processing and p5.js ecosystems. The goal is to help participants grow into skilled coders and stewards in the open-source community.
