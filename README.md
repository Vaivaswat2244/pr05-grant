The Processing Foundation Software Development Grant or `pr05` (pronounced “pros”) is a grant and mentorship initiative by the Processing Foundation designed to support the professional growth of early to mid-career software developers through hands-on involvement in open-source projects. Participation in the program is entirely online.
