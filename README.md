The Processing Foundation Software Development Grant or `pr05` (pronounced “pros”) is a mentorship initiative by the Processing Foundation designed to support the professional growth of early to mid-career software developers through hands-on involvement in open-source projects. Participation in the program is entirely online and we invite developers from around the world to apply. 

A total of three (3) candidates will be invited to join our 2025 cohort. Selected candidates will receive a $10,000 grant to allow them to spend 200 hours over a period of 4 months on their contributions.

### Expectations
We expect grantees to connect with their cohort, offer mutual support, and take part in regular virtual meetings with their mentor throughout the program. Attendance is required by grantees at bi-monthly cohort meets, bi-monthly one-on-one mentor meetings, workshops, and town halls. Grantees should produce detailled documentation about their process and the outcomes of their work.

### Documentation and Project Legacy
We ask participants to share monthly progress updates during the program, as well as a wrap-up blog post at the end of the grant period. A technical report will also be required to be submitted as a Pull Request to the appropriate repository in the Processing Foundation’s GitHub. Additional documentation in other formats are also welcome (a series of video tutorials, a website, etc.) as desired by the grantee.

All `pr05` projects must be released as open-source under a Free Software license such as LGPL 2.1 or GPL 2.0. We may ask contributors to submit their work to repositories under the Processing Foundation organization on GitHub.

Projects are featured on the Processing Foundation’s website, with the grantee’s bio, images, and a link to the project. These materials must be provided by the start of the program and updated at the end.

### Mentorship
Mentors are assigned to each Grantee. Mentors are experienced software professionals and/or core contributors from the Processing and p5.js communities. The role of mentors is to provide guidance (creative, technical, and professional), as well as serve as an advocate for the grantee’s work. Grantees are expected to participate in regular virtual meetings with their mentor. Mentors will also be responsible for evaluating the work done by their mentee at the mid-point and at the end of the program.

### Stipend
The stipend for the 2025 `pr05` grant program is $10,000 USD. Payment of the stipend will be made in four installments: $2,500 USD paid at the start of your project, the remaining split throughout the program, and the remainder upon its completion. Full payment of the grant requires complete and active participation in the program, including cohort meetings, town halls, regular meetings with mentors, and successful evaluations.

### Program Timeline
Processing Foundation Grantees are expected to commit 200 hours to proposed projects, between July 1st and November 15th, 2024. The 200 hours must take place during this timeline.

### Town halls
Throughout the program, monthly meetings guided by invited experts. These sessions are meant to expand participants' understanding of the broader context in which their technical work resides, ensuring they are well-rounded in both their coding abilities and their comprehension of the ethical and operational frameworks of the software. Town halls are hosted together with our partner program the Processing Fellowship.

## Automated Text Generation Policy

Lately, we’ve been seeing more and more applications that look like they were written mostly by AI. It’s making it harder for our reviewers to go through everything and means that solid, original proposals don’t always get all the attention they deserve. We don’t love that.

If you choose to use large language models (LLMs) when writing your proposal, that’s fine, but please make sure that your own knowledge, ideas, and insights are at the core of your submission. We’re not judging your proposal based on how polished the writing is. We care a lot more about how clearly you explain your thinking and how well you understand the project. A personal and thoughtful application with a few typos is way better than a perfectly written one that misses the point of the project.

AI tools can be helpful, but only if you actually understand the context well enough to ask good questions and make sense of the answers. If anything’s unclear, take some time to check out the links we’ve shared, look through the relevant repositories, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you still have questions. This will make your proposal stronger than any large language model can. We promise!
