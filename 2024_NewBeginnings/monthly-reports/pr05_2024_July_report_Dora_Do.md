# July monthly report: Prototyping a collaborative code editor for Processing
By Dora Do

## Completed Tasks

The focus of the first month of this project was about research, technical feasibility, and project scoping.

- Created a [Github repo](https://github.com/doradocodes/processing-collab-editor) for this project and [Github Project](https://github.com/users/doradocodes/projects/1) to track tasks and progress
- Created a prototype of an Electron app that can run Java processes and display logs from the process on the app
- Create a [MVP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rbMAvGepee8lPmaNjLItSL4Ah5MW0jLUfjhWWO8HgyQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- Researched different frameworks (ie. Theia, CodeMirror, JupyterLab, VSCodium) and tools (ie. yjs, CodeMirror collab editing)
- Created a test project of Theia and experimented with customization
- Created a test project of an Electron app with CodeMirror
- Create a [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/SxmAa94lAP37OLPpY1hgVf/Processing-Collaborative-Editor-(PCE)?node-id=5-21&t=4mR3IQXoh30vJv6m-1) with initial wireframes and inspiration gathering

## Challenges

- Testing some of the frameworks to see if they were customizable to our needs took a while. I ran into many errors trying to run the projects
- Through researching the different options, we are still having a hard time choosing which direction to go since each have their own pros/cons
- There are a lot of ideas about reimagining editor, versus matching the functionality of the current Processing IDE. There are many different directions for how this IDE could be used, and determining which audience or type of user that we want to target

## Upcoming plans

- By the end of the first week of August, we should choose a direction for implementation, whether it be using an existing framework like Theia, or doing a custom build. During our next cohort meeting, I will be sharing out the findings from my research and to get the opinions of the cohort members, especially since some have experience with libraries we are thinking of using, like CodeMirror
- While we decide on the direction of how this prototype should be built, I will also start creating wireframe sketches of how the editor would look, and start getting feedback on those designs
- Once the designs are down, I will start breaking down MVP into tasks, and tracking them on Github Projects
