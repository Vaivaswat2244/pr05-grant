# July Progress Report

## Project Title: Enhancing the p5.js Editor with CodeMirror 6 and React Functional Components

### Project Description
Upgrade the CodeMirror component in the p5.js Editor from Version 5 to Version 6, implementing enhanced features for accessibility, mobile support, internationalization, and other editor improvements. This will also require refactoring related components from class-based to functional components using React.

### Execution Plan
1. **CodeMirror 5 to 6 Transition**
   - Identify and import necessary sub-packages under the @codemirror scope.
   - Refactor existing methods into transactions and dispatch them collectively.
2. **React Component Refactor**
   - Convert class-based React components to functional components.
   - Use tools like ChatGPT for initial translations, build and run the code to identify necessary corrections.
3. **TypeScript Conversion**
   - Convert JavaScript-based codebase to TypeScript for files that require immediate changes.
   - Understand variable and function definitions through TypeScript to improve development efficiency.

### Timeline
**Month 1: Planning and Initial Setup**
* **Week 1-2:**
  - Review the existing p5.js codebase.
  - Set up development environment.
  - Identify key components to be refactored and upgraded.
  - Start setting epics and adding tickets on Zenhub board
* **Week 3-4:**
  - Begin the conversion of simple class components to functional components.
  - Start importing necessary sub-packages for CodeMirror 6.

## Progress for July

### Completed Tasks
- Synced the personal forked repo with the most updated p5.js editor repo.
- Met with the mentor Connie on July 5th, 2024.
  - Introduced ourselves to each other.
  - Set up the bi-weekly meeting schedule (Monday 8 PM EST).
  - Discussed scope, timeline, and conventions (synchronize prettier style with the original p5 editor branch).
- Created a project plan document.

### Challenges Encountered
- Initial synchronization of the forked repository took longer than expected due to merge conflicts and dependency updates.

### Plans for August
- **Week 1-2:**
  - Continue conversion of simple class components to functional components.
  - Begin importing necessary sub-packages for CodeMirror 6.
  - Set up initial CodeMirror transactions.
- **Week 3-4:**
  - Test and debug the refactored components.
  - Start the integration of CodeMirror 6 with the p5.js Editor.

### Note
- I couldn't make significant progress in the last week of July due to personal reasons.
