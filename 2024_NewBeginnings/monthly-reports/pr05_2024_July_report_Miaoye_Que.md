# Revamp the Friendly Error System (FES) in p5.js

## Completed Tasks

- Conducted research for the project's 2 top priorities: discover accidentally overridden constants and functions, and parameter validation.
- Based on research, prior work, and guidance from mentors, drafted a [project plan](https://github.com/sproutleaf/pr05-fes/blob/main/project_plan.md) with proposed approaches, road map, and project timeline.

## Challenges Encountered

The month of July was pretty smooth for me, because my focus was on research, experimentation, and writing. I anticipate encountering many more challenges once the implementation stage begins.

## Plan For the Upcoming Month

I am currently on a break between grad school and a full-time job that is going to start in early September. Due to the way my obligations are set up, August will be a big implementation month for me with regards to grant work. On a high level, I plan to finish, or be close to finishing, the implementation of both FES priorities (accidentally overridden constants and functions, parameter validation). For more detailed plans, please refer to the [road map section](https://github.com/sproutleaf/pr05-fes/blob/main/project_plan.md) of my project plan.
